                    <p class="hastings"> I come from Colorado, in a little town known as Holyoke.
                        I have four sisters one of which attended Hastings College
                        as part of the Class of 2015. My <span> Father </span> earned the degree
                        Doctor of Chiropractics from <strong> Palmer College of Chiropractics </strong>,
                        My Mother has her hands full at home with my younger, more active
                        sister, along with a very happy <em> Golden Retreiver </em> pup named, Gus.
                        Two of my sisters live in Granbury, Texas, working as Boarding House
                        Parents. I am now a student at Hastings College, studing <em> Computer Science </em>
                        and <em> Small Business </em>.

                    <p class="hastings"> If I could become a professional movie viewer, I would.
                        Aside from watching movies, I enjoy a casual game of golf
                        with my friends ever so often. I was on my high school team
                        as the fifth <strong> Varsity </strong> member. This meant that I was the Best JR. Varsity
                        player, but was not good enough to play Varsity. Although I enjoy
                        being outside, I'll gladly spend the entire day inside with people that make
                        me happy. I chose to pursue Computer Science because its a field with demand,
                        I enjoy it, so I dont mind.

                        I'll try my best to do so. I wasn't entirely sure how this credit system
                        worked, I signed up for 18 hours. When i told my parents that they responded
                        roughly along the lines of "You won't have a <strong> Social Life </strong>." I wasn't to worried about
                        having one anyways. I did spread out my classes as much as I could, I didn't
                        want to get to much on my plate for any one day. I have three classes on Monday,
                        Two on Wednesday, and Friday, and three others on Tuesday and Thursday. I've set
                        a goal to finish in Three years and I don't plan on letting up.
